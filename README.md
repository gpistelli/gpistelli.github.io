  ## About me

  ![](profile-pic.png)

I'm a Sociology researcher based in Brazil. Currently, I've just finished my Masters and I'm looking for new opportunities to express my skills and contribute applying my knowledge to different domains of sociology, data science, network with researchers all around the world and help people in the public debate. I hope to keep this page as a space to link together all my contributions with research, code and new ideas. You can reach me through <gabriel.pistelli.ferreira@gmail.com>. You can find me also in:

  ## Research
  Lately, I've been focusing my research in basically three main objects: a) Brazilian Industrialists and their political and economic ideologies, with a special focus in 2017 Brazilian Labor Reform, closely followed by my mentor; b) Industrialists' collective action, focusing more on their division inside their associations and social composition; and d) new methods inspired from Data Science to apply within social sciences research. All my research have been heavily influenced by Marxist and Bourdieusian researchers, and my theoretical position is to find a creative combination between these two different paradigms. I'm interested in studying social classes, collective action, elites and inequalities through innovative methods and new perspectives.
  
  ### Master Thesis
  My master thesis focused in understanding the effects of Brazilian 2017 Labor Reform in employers unions collective action and the peculiarities of their collective action. It can be accessed through the following links:

  ### Bachelor Thesis

  A content analysis of CNI (National Industrialists Confederation) discourse about Labor Reform in Brazil and their political and economic ideologies during the 2002-2017 timeline.

  ## Data Science
  
  Another pretty significant part of my activities is trying to analyze data for scientific divulgation purposes and contribute to new methods of research while developing my programming skills. For now, I'm relatively experienced in using R and starting to develop better my Python skills. I'm especially focused in Geometric Data Analysis, Social Network Analysis, Scraping, NLP, Classification and some Machine Learning algorithms, trying to focus in an inferential approach to statistics.
  
  ### R Packages
  
    We're developing some packages, which are going to be updated soon in our GitHub.
